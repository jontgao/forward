Usually, efficient data structures are key to designing efficient algorithms . Some formal design methods and programming languages emphasize data structures, rather than algorithms, as the key organizing factor in software design. Data structures can be used to organize the storage and retrieval of information stored in both main memory and secondary memory .")[[3]](https://happycoding.io/tutorials/interviewing/history "Cited text: But I think understanding the history of data structures and algorithms, and how they’ve been used in interviews over time, can help them feel more approachable.

History

Data structures have a rich history, dating back to the early days of computer programming.[[0]](https://gist.github.com/CMCDragonkai/d266a3055735545447439f0fa662a0e1 "Cited text: Download ZIP History Data Structures Raw history_data_structures.md History Data Structures For stateful applications, there are 5 different ways of managing the history of state: No History - Living in the moment. - Examples: Any stateful application that doesn't discards all previous states upon mutation.

They're designed by composing data elements into a logical unit representing an abstract data type that has relevance to the algorithm or application. An example of an abstract data type is a customer name that's composed of the character strings for first name, middle name and last name. It's not only important to use data structures, but it's also important to choose the proper data structure for each task.") The first data structures were based on classical algorithms such as sorting and searching, which were used to organize and access data within a system.[[0]](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/data-structure "Cited text: What is a data structure?

Then, it is not suitable for the analysis or operations.")[[2]](https://www.elastic.co/blog/understanding-ai-search-algorithms "Cited text: What is a search algorithm in AI? An AI search algorithm is the method for understanding natural language queries and finding relevant results by evaluating indexed data and documents. It does this by exploring a set of potential solutions in order to find the best answer or solution to the query it's given. Imagine you’re building a chess application using artificial intelligence that predicts the best move to make next.") The concept of a data structure was introduced by Alan Perlis in the late 1960s, and further developed by many researchers during the 1970s and 1980s.[[0]](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-data-structures-that-every-programmer-must-know/ "Cited text: Top Data structure that every programmer must know Now, as we know about data structure and its importance, let's take a look at the most common Data structure that every programmer must know: 1.

One of the most important developments in data structures was the invention of the stack, which was used to implement priority queues.[[0]](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/priority-queue-set-1-introduction/ "Cited text: Practice A priority queue is a type of queue that arranges elements based on their priority values. Each element has a priority associated. When we add an item, it is inserted in a position based on its priority. Elements with higher priority are typically retrieved or removed before elements with lower priority.")[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type) "Cited text: [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Klaus Samelson and Friedrich L. Bauer of Technical University Munich proposed the idea of a stack called Operationskeller (\"operational cellar\") in 1955 [ 6 ] [ 7 ] and filed a patent in 1957. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] In March 1988, by which time Samelson was deceased, Bauer received the IEEE Computer Pioneer Award for the invention of the stack principle. [ 12 ] [ 7 ] Similar concepts were independently developed by Charles Leonard Hamblin in the first half of 1954 [ 13 ] [ 7 ] and by Wilhelm Kämmerer [ de ] with his automatisches Gedächtnis (\"automatic memory\") in 1958. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 7 ] Stacks are often described using the analogy of a spring-loaded stack of plates in a cafeteria.") This was a key concept in the development of data structures for the early internet, as it allowed for efficient communication between applications.[[0]](https://www.scholarhat.com/tutorial/datastructures/abstract-data-type "Cited text: Abstract data type (ADT) is a concept or model of a data type. It does not specify how data will be organized in memory and what algorithms will be used for implementing the operations. It is called “abstract” because it gives an implementation-independent view.

Data structures are a fundamental component of computer science because they give form to abstract data points. In this way, they allow users and systems to efficiently organize, work with and store data.")[[1]](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/definition/structured-programming-modular-programming "Cited text: Structured programming, or modular programming, is a programming paradigm that facilitates the creation of programs with readable code and reusable components. All modern programming languages support structured programming, but the mechanisms of support -- like the syntax of the programming languages -- vary. However, when modules are reused, it's possible to compromise data security and governance , so it's important to define and enforce a privacy policy controlling the use of modules that bring with them implicit data access rights. Structured programming encourages dividing an application program into a hierarchy of modules or autonomous elements, which, in turn, may contain other such elements.")[[2]](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/algorithm "Cited text: An algorithm is a procedure used for solving a problem or performing a computation. Algorithms act as an exact list of instructions that conduct specified actions step by step in either hardware- or software-based routines. Algorithms are widely used throughout all areas of IT. In mathematics, computer programming and computer science, an algorithm usually refers to a small procedure that solves a recurrent problem.")[[3]](https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/data-type "Cited text: What is a data type? Share this item with your network: By Rahul Awati Published: Apr 16, 2025 In software programming, a data type refers to the type of value a variable has and what type of mathematical, relational or logical operations can be applied on it without causing an error. For example, many programming languages use the data type string to classify text, integer to identify whole numbers and floating point to designate numbers with decimal points.")[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion "Cited text: Recursion is the process a procedure goes through when one of the steps of the procedure involves invoking the procedure itself. A procedure that goes through recursion is said to be 'recursive'. [ 3 ] To understand recursion, one must recognize the distinction between a procedure and the running of a procedure. A procedure is a set of steps based on a set of rules, while the running of a procedure involves actually following the rules and performing the steps.")
