The Council has become the principal operating agency of both the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering in providing services to the government, the public, and the scientific and engineering communities.", "url": "https://history.aip.org/phn/21511003.html", "query": "What is the National Research Council?", "sents_per_passage": 4, "retrieval_score": 8.667821884155273, "score": 0.11286910623311996}, {"text": "The National Research Council (NRC) carries out most of the studies done by the NAS as well as the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) and the Institute of Medicine (IOM).
