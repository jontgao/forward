      "Survey: Introduction to Data Structures\n",
      "\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Data Structures are an essential part of any software development process. They define how data is organized and accessed within a system. This survey aims to provide an overview of the key concepts surrounding data structures, including their history, key ideas, variations, and applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "History\n",
      "\n",
      "Data structures have a rich history, dating back to the early days of computer programming. The first data structures were based on classical algorithms such as sorting and searching, which were used to organize and access data within a system. The concept of a data structure was introduced by Alan Perlis in the late 1960s, and further developed by many researchers during the 1970s and 1980s.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most important developments in data structures was the invention of the stack, which was used to implement priority queues. This was a key concept in the development of data structures for the early internet, as it allowed for efficient communication between applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key Ideas\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Data Structures define how data is organized and accessed within a system.\n",
      "2. Data structures include structures, which are composed of data and operations, and algorithms, which are functions that manipulate data.\n",
      "3. Data structures can be used for a variety of tasks, including sorting, searching, indexing, and manipulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Variations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Linked Data Structures, also known as linked lists, are a type of data structure that uses pointers to access data.\n",
      "2. Hash Tables, which are used to store and retrieve data based on hash values.\n",
      "3. Stacks and Queues, which are data structures used to implement priority queues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Applications\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Sorting algorithms are used to organize and access data within a system.\n",
      "2. Search algorithms are used to find particular elements within a data structure.\n",
      "3. Indexing is used to find specific elements within a data structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Motivation behind concept\n",
      "\n",
      "Data structures are an essential part of software development, as they define how data is organized and accessed within a system. They are critical in ensuring that data is stored and accessed in a way that is efficient and accurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Related ideas\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Data mining, which is the use of data structures and algorithms to extract insight and insights from large datasets.\n",
      "2. Graphs, which are data structures used for representing and manipulating complex networks.\n",
      "3. Concurrency, which is the use of data structures to manage data sharing and synchronization, which can lead to better performance and scalability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Data structures are an essential part of any software development process. They define how data is organized and accessed within a system. This survey provides a brief overview of the key concepts surrounding data structures, including their history, key ideas, variations, and applications. By understanding the history and motivation behind data structures, you can develop better data structures for your software projects.\n"

But that is due to ice nucleation — impurities in everyday water raise its freezing point to this temperature. Now, researchers unveil a theoretical model that shows how specific structural details on surfaces can influence water’s freezing point. The researchers will present their results at the spring meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS).',\n",

The freezing point of water describes the point at which water transitions from a liquid to a solid ( ice ), while the melting point is the temperature at which water turns from a solid (ice) to a liquid. In theory, the two temperatures would be the same, but liquids can be supercooled beyond their freezing points so that they don't solidify until well below the freezing point. Ordinarily, the freezing and melting point of water is 0 °C or 32 °F .\",\n",
